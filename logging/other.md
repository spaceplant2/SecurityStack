# Alternative Log Monitoring Platforms

All of the log based solutions seem to be either a variant of the ELK stak, or a complete re-imagining of the end result but created using different moving parts. In any case, these tools are all pretty amazing and worth looking into.

And the OG: [ELK](https://www.elastic.co/elastic-stack)  

An interesting side note: [Wazuh](https://wazuh.com/) also runs on quite a bit of the same pieces: Elasticsearch (or Opensearch) and Logstash, but supplies an entirely different end result.
