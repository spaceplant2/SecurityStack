# OPNSense
*Open source next-generation firewall*

OPNSense is an open source firewall that can be hosted on commonly available platforms. The major benefit of OPNSense in this instance is that it is more manual. Setup is fairly easy, but still required as opposed to being set up **automagically** by a specialist. So build out the subnets, add block and allow rules, connect the IDS system and even configure traffic decryption. Then when reviewing the logs, you have a better understanding of what is going on and how to better remediate problems.
