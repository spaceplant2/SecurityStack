# Visualizations

We should all be familiar with the data-to-picture abilities of [Grafana](https://grafana.com/) by now, as well as the ability to create multiple dashboards in order to present data from different perspectives. It is an integral part of my security stack because of this. [Kibana](https://www.elastic.co/kibana) and orther offerings exist bbecause data visualization has been pretty normalized throughout technology.

For my security stack, there are several vital functions that I will be certain to build. The most obvious is a representation of monitored endoints and their status- we need to know when our environment is struggling, right? Alerts and their serverity is another basic need. Maps showing inbound and outbound connections based on geographic location help to highlight unusual events. The reality of data visualization is that it is maleable and extendible, making it a vital member of our security apparatus.
